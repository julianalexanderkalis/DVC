Question 1:

Smoothing helps us to reduce noise and certain discontinuities within the data. With smoothing, we can approximate the curve without drifting away from the 
original one by a significant amount. When we work with time series data, we can also use smoothing to smooth short term variations or some seasonal trends that may occur in 
our data.

Question 2:

The larger we set the window size, the more periods are considered when smoothing the curve. When we use a larger window, we smooth by more periods which can help us simplify
the curve even more, but this comes at the cost of accuracy.
